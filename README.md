## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
````

If you plan to run notebooks:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

---

## 📥 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tusharxhub/ML.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ML
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open any notebook and start experimenting.

---

## 📊 Usage

Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations alongside code.

A typical workflow followed in the notebooks:

1. Load the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train the machine learning model
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Visualize results and insights

Example code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
