# !  Write python program to implement Simple Linear Regression from scratch using two 
# ! different optimization methods—Ordinary Least Squares (Closed-form) and Gradient Descent 
# ! (Iterative)—and evaluate their performance using five key regression metrics.  
# ! Part 1: Data Generation  
# ! Generate a synthetic dataset with a linear relationship and some added noise:  
# ! x values: 100 random points between 0 and 50.  
# ! y values: y = 3x + 7 + noise (where noise is a random Gaussian distribution).  
# ! Part 2: Implementation (No Libraries)  
# ! You are prohibited from using scikit-learn for the model or metrics. You may use NumPy for 
# ! array operations and Matplotlib for plotting.  
# ! Function 1: fit_ols(x, y) – Returns m and c using the closed-form equations. 
# ! Function 2: fit_gd(x, y, learning_rate, epochs) – Returns m and c after n iterations.  
# ! Function 3: evaluate_metrics(y_true, y_pred, n_features) – Returns a dictionary of the 
# ! five metrics.  
# ! Part 3: The Metrics Suite Calculate the following for both models: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, 
# ! Adjusted R2 score.
